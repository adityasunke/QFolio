          Q-Folio is an innovative quantum finance project that explores the intersection of quantum 
          computing and portfolio optimization. Leveraging the power of the Quantum Approximate Optimization 
          Algorithm (QAOA), Q-Folio tackles the complex problem of optimizing investment allocations among 
          the Magnificent 7 stocksâ€”a group of leading technology companies dominating the market.
          At the heart of Q-Folio lies the Markowitz Portfolio Theory, which provides a mathematical 
          framework to balance risk and return in investment portfolios. By translating this classical 
          financial model into a quantum optimization problem, Q-Folio aims to discover portfolio 
          allocations that maximize expected returns while minimizing risk more efficiently than 
          traditional methods. Q-Folio demonstrates how quantum computing can transform financial 
          decision-making, offering new computational approaches for solving problems that are otherwise 
          challenging for classical computers. This project serves as a proof-of-concept for the future of 
          quantum-enhanced financial analytics and portfolio management.
